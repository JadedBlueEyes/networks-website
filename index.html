        <h2 id="what-is-a-network">What is a network?</h2>
        <p>A network is two or more nodes (computers, servers or other electronic devices) that are connected together
            and are able to communicate.</p>
        <p>Many computer networks will have one or more servers, which are powerful computers that often acts as a
            central hub for services in a network like emails, internet access or file storage. Each computer connected
            to a server is called a client.</p>
        <p>A computer that is not connected to a network is called a standalone computer.</p>
        <h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-a-network">What are the benefits of a network?</h3>
        <p>Using a network allows you to share resources, like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>hardware, such as a printers</li>
            <li>software, allowing multiple users to run the same programs on different computers</li>
            <li>data, so that other people can access shared work and you can access your data from any computer on the
                network</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Networking is critical if you want to use your computer to communicate. Without it you couldn’t send an email
            or an instant message.</p>
        <p>We use a huge network on a daily basis and this is called the internet. Around three billion people use the
            internet to share data, news and other resources, amongst many other things.</p>

        <h3 id="what-problems-can-occur-with-a-network">What problems can occur with a network?</h3>
        <p>If we connect computers or devices together in a network we can expose ourselves to some problems.</p>
        <p>If the network breaks, this can make a number of tasks it is used for quite difficult. For example, it might
            not be possible to share photographs with friends.</p>
        <p>If computers and devices are networked together, we can expose ourselves to hackers and viruses. Most viruses
            are spread over a network and most hackers use a network to access other people’s computers. Without a
            network connection, a hacker would have to physically get to your computer.</p>
